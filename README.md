Parental Leave Planner (Sweden) ‚Äî React + Vite + Tailwind

Plan and track Swedish parental leave with a fast, visual calendar. Tag each day for Parent A/B, choose fraction and day type (SBL/MIN/OFF), mark ‚Äúreserved‚Äù days, and see live checks for Swedish rules (double days, 15-month window, post-4 saving cap, SGI weekly check, etc.). Data is stored locally and can be exported/imported as JSON.

‚ö†Ô∏è This tool helps with planning only. It is not legal or financial advice.

90 reserved days per parent (non-transferable)

Double days: up to 15 months of age, max 60 per parent (120 total).
Reserved cannot be used as double days.
